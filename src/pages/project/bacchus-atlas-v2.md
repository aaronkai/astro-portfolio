Bacchus Atlas was a rework of the original page I built in Gatsby, after learning the limitations of the Sanity backend. This site is build in NextJS. It utilizes Apollo and GQL. It runs KeystoneJS on the backend to handle authentication, and runs postgres for its database. It is still a work in progress, but essential functionality is in place. A user can log in, add wines to the database, geolocate them on a map, and rate them.
