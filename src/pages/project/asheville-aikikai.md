I built this site on spec for a local dojo in in SvelteKit as a redesign of their aging WordPress site. Orignally designed to be a static site, I later converted it to server-side rendering to accomodate a backend CMS, which I did in Sanity to allow stakeholders to dynamically edit content. I designed the logo and applied stock assets as placeholders.
