I've been in the market for a backend SaS provider that could be a one-stop-shop for my lil apps. I heard about [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) from the [Remotely Interesting](https://dev.to/jsparty) podcast and it sounded promising.

I'm glad I checked it out. They host a database for you and do auth via an easy to use API. They had a svelte example project that I used quite a bit to make a little social-media pre-registation page I gave the pun-tastic name [SiteGeist](https://sitegeist.netlify.app/) (sightGeist and shiteGeist were close contenders.)

The only downside I've come across is that I'm trying to learn TypeScript and they don't have full TypeScript support for the supabase-js library yet.

I'm excited to try it out for a more complex project: I'm thinking I might make a simple 'set tracker' for a HIIT-type or circut-training-type workout. I do those a couple of times a week and I'm always losing my place because I'm listening to some in-depth podcast :)

Onward and Upward!
