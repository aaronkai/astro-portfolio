Well, here we go, the very first blog post.

I created this blog using a [tutorial by WebJeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKKgT0SEioI&list=PLm_Qt4aKpfKgonq1zwaCS6kOD-nbOKx7V). TBH, it was a bit rough around the edges, but it got me where I needed to go.

I've never successfully been able to stick to a blog. This seems to be a common enough problem that I encounter more content about how to stick to your blog than actual content in a blog. Jokes aside, I do use blogs that developers have written on occasion to solve a problem I'm having that they've had.

That will be the animating principle of this blog. Write about a problem and it's solution.
